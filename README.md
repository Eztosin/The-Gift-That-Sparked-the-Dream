# The Gift That Sparked the Dream

My submission for the DEV Frontend Challenge: June Celebrations (CSS Art Prompt).

This project is a personal and interactive CSS illustration dedicated to my father for Father's Day. It tells the story of how his gift of a first computer ignited my passion for technology and set the course for my career.

## 💡 The Concept: A Story in Three Acts

This isn't just a static piece of art; it's an interactive narrative that progresses through three stages of a developer's journey, each triggered by the user.

### Act I: The Gift

The opening scene shows the foundational moment—a father giving his child a glowing laptop. It's a scene filled with potential and quiet excitement.

### Act II: The Learning

The story shifts to focus on the child, engrossed in the laptop, learning to code. The father fades into the background, symbolizing his supportive but non-intrusive presence during the long nights of practice and debugging.

### Act III: The Career

The child is now an adult, dressed in professional attire. The successful outcome of the journey is celebrated with a continuous, looping fireworks display, representing the dream being realized.

## ✨ Features Checklist

- 🎭 **Interactive 3-Act Story**: Use the buttons to switch between the "Gift," "Learning," and "Career" scenes.
- 🎆 **Looping Fireworks Display**: The career celebration is brought to life with a multi-particle fireworks effect built with a pure CSS box-shadow trick.
- 🧥 **Dynamic CSS Clothing**: Characters are clothed using layered linear-gradient backgrounds, adding detail without extra HTML.
- 🖼️ **Flipping Photo Frame**: An interactive photo frame reveals a hidden message and changes its caption based on the active scene.
- ✍️ **Dynamic Text**: Quotes and code snippets on the laptop screen update as the story progresses.
- ♿ **Accessibility Focused**:
  - Includes aria-label attributes on all key elements for screen reader users.
  - Respects user preferences with a prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable animations.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design**: The entire scene adapts gracefully to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structured with semantic elements.
- **CSS3**: Utilizes modern CSS features including:
  - Flexbox for layout.
  - Advanced Animations & Keyframes.
  - Pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) for details.
  - CSS Variables and calc().
- **JavaScript**: Used for handling the scene-switching logic and managing the interactive state of the application.
